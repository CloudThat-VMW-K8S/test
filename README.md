**Haris AK**: create a Kubeadm cluster with 3 master nodes and 2 worker nodes

--------
**ChatGPT**: To create a Kubeadm cluster with 3 master nodes and 2 worker nodes, you can follow the steps below:

Set up the Virtual Machines (VMs) for the cluster. You can use any virtualization technology like VirtualBox or VMWare. Ensure that the VMs have a minimum of 2GB RAM and 2 CPUs.

Install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on all the VMs.

Disable swap on all the VMs using the command ```sudo swapoff -a```.

Install the necessary packages on all the VMs by running the following command:

```sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common```

Add the Kubernetes signing key on all the VMs using the command:

```curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -```

Add the Kubernetes repository on all the VMs using the command:

```sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main"```

Install Kubernetes on all the VMs using the command:

```sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl```

On the first master node, initialize the cluster by running the command:

```sudo kubeadm init --control-plane-endpoint "LOAD_BALANCER_DNS:LOAD_BALANCER_PORT" --upload-certs --apiserver-cert-extra-sans="MASTER_NODE_1_IP,MASTER_NODE_2_IP,MASTER_NODE_3_IP"```

Replace ```LOAD_BALANCER_DNS``` with the DNS name or IP address of the load balancer and ```LOAD_BALANCER_PORT``` with the port number used for the load balancer. Replace ```MASTER_NODE_1_IP```, ```MASTER_NODE_2_IP```, and ```MASTER_NODE_3_IP``` with the IP addresses of the three master nodes.

After the initialization is complete, copy the kubeconfig file to your home directory using the command:

```mkdir -p $HOME/.kube &amp;&amp; sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config &amp;&amp; sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config```

Install the pod network add-on by running the command:

```kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml```

Join the other two master nodes to the cluster by running the command generated by ```kubeadm init``` on the first master node. The command will look something like this:

```sudo kubeadm join LOAD_BALANCER_DNS:LOAD_BALANCER_PORT --token TOKEN --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash SHA256_HASH --control-plane --certificate-key CERTIFICATE_KEY --apiserver-cert-extra-sans="MASTER_NODE_1_IP,MASTER_NODE_2_IP,MASTER_NODE_3_IP"```

Replace ```LOAD_BALANCER_DNS``` with the DNS name or IP address of the load balancer and ```LOAD_BALANCER_PORT``` with the port number used for the load balancer. Replace ```TOKEN``` with the token generated by ```kubeadm init```. Replace ```SHA256_HASH``` with the certificate hash generated by ```kubeadm init```. Replace ```MASTER_NODE_1_IP```, ```MASTER_NODE_2_IP```, and ```MASTER_NODE_3_IP``` with the IP addresses of the three master nodes. Replace ```CERTIFICATE_KEY``` with the certificate key generated by ```kubeadm init```.

Join the worker nodes to the cluster by running the command generated by `kubeadm

--------
**Haris AK**: how to join worker nodes to above cluster

--------
**ChatGPT**: To join worker nodes to the Kubeadm cluster with 3 master nodes that we created earlier, you can follow the steps below:

SSH into the worker nodes using the command ```ssh &lt;worker-node-IP&gt;```.

Install the necessary packages on the worker nodes by running the following command:

```sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common```

Add the Kubernetes signing key on the worker nodes using the command:

```curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -```

Add the Kubernetes repository on the worker nodes using the command:

```sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main"```

Install Kubernetes on the worker nodes using the command:

```sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl```

On any of the master nodes, generate the join command for the worker nodes by running the command:

```sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command```

This command will generate a token and the join command that you can use to join worker nodes to the cluster.

Copy the join command generated in step 6 and paste it in the worker nodes terminal.

The command should look something like this:

```sudo kubeadm join LOAD_BALANCER_DNS:LOAD_BALANCER_PORT --token TOKEN --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash SHA256_HASH```

Replace ```LOAD_BALANCER_DNS``` with the DNS name or IP address of the load balancer and ```LOAD_BALANCER_PORT``` with the port number used for the load balancer. Replace ```TOKEN``` with the token generated by the ```kubeadm token create``` command. Replace ```SHA256_HASH``` with the certificate hash generated by the ```kubeadm token create``` command.

Verify that the worker nodes have successfully joined the cluster by running the command ```kubectl get nodes``` on any of the master nodes. The output should show all the nodes in the cluster, including the worker nodes.

**Haris AK**: Can you convert the above results into a lab format

--------
**ChatGPT**: Sure, here is a step-by-step lab format for joining worker nodes to a Kubeadm cluster with 3 master nodes:

Objective: Join 2 worker nodes to a Kubeadm cluster with 3 master nodes.

Prerequisites:3 Ubuntu 20.04 servers with at least 2 CPU and 4 GB RAM each.The 3 servers must have unique hostname, IP address, and SSH access enabled.A load balancer must be set up to distribute traffic among the 3 master nodes.You must have root or sudo privileges on all servers.

Steps:

On all 5 nodes:

SSH into each node using the command ```ssh &lt;username&gt;@&lt;node-IP&gt;``` and enter your password when prompted.

Update the package index and install the necessary packages by running the following command:sql
```sql
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
```

Add the Kubernetes signing key by running the following command:arduino
```arduino
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Add the Kubernetes repository by running the following command:csharp
```csharp
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main"
```

Install Kubernetes by running the following command:sql
```sql
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

On any of the 3 master nodes:
6. Initialize the cluster by running the following command:php
```php-template
sudo kubeadm init --control-plane-endpoint "&lt;LOAD_BALANCER_DNS&gt;:&lt;LOAD_BALANCER_PORT&gt;" --upload-certs --apiserver-advertise-address=&lt;MASTER_NODE_IP&gt;
```

Replace ```&lt;LOAD_BALANCER_DNS&gt;``` with the DNS name or IP address of the load balancer, ```&lt;LOAD_BALANCER_PORT&gt;``` with the port number used for the load balancer, and ```&lt;MASTER_NODE_IP&gt;``` with the IP address of the current master node.

The output of this command will include a token and the command to join worker nodes to the cluster.Copy the command generated in the output of the previous step to join worker nodes to the cluster.

On the 2 worker nodes:
8. Paste the command copied in step 7 to join the worker nodes to the cluster.

Verify that the worker nodes have joined the cluster by running the following command on any of the master nodes:arduino
```arduino
kubectl get nodes
```

The output should show all the nodes in the cluster, including the 2 worker nodes.

Congratulations! You have successfully joined 2 worker nodes to a Kubeadm cluster with 3 master nodes.
