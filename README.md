#Lab1: Creating an HA Kubeadm Cluster
 
##To create a Kubeadm cluster with 3 master nodes and 2 worker nodes, you can follow the steps below: 
1. Set up the Virtual Machines (VMs) for the cluster. You can use any virtualization technology like VirtualBox or VMWare. Ensure that the VMs have a minimum of 2GB RAM and 2 CPUs. 
2. Install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on all the VMs. 
3. Disable swap on all the VMs using the command `sudo swapoff -a`. 
4. Install the necessary packages on all the VMs by running the following command:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common` 
5. Add the Kubernetes signing key on all the VMs using the command:

`curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -` 
6. Add the Kubernetes repository on all the VMs using the command:

`sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main"` 
7. Install Kubernetes on all the VMs using the command:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl` 
8. On the first master node, initialize the cluster by running the command:

`sudo kubeadm init --control-plane-endpoint "LOAD_BALANCER_DNS:LOAD_BALANCER_PORT" --upload-certs --apiserver-cert-extra-sans="MASTER_NODE_1_IP,MASTER_NODE_2_IP,MASTER_NODE_3_IP"`

Replace `LOAD_BALANCER_DNS` with the DNS name or IP address of the load balancer and `LOAD_BALANCER_PORT` with the port number used for the load balancer. Replace `MASTER_NODE_1_IP`, `MASTER_NODE_2_IP`, and `MASTER_NODE_3_IP` with the IP addresses of the three master nodes. 
9. After the initialization is complete, copy the kubeconfig file to your home directory using the command:

`mkdir -p $HOME/.kube && sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config && sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config` 
10. Install the pod network add-on by running the command:

`kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml` 
11. Join the other two master nodes to the cluster by running the command generated by `kubeadm init` on the first master node. The command will look something like this:

`sudo kubeadm join LOAD_BALANCER_DNS:LOAD_BALANCER_PORT --token TOKEN --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash SHA256_HASH --control-plane --certificate-key CERTIFICATE_KEY --apiserver-cert-extra-sans="MASTER_NODE_1_IP,MASTER_NODE_2_IP,MASTER_NODE_3_IP"`

Replace `LOAD_BALANCER_DNS` with the DNS name or IP address of the load balancer and `LOAD_BALANCER_PORT` with the port number used for the load balancer. Replace `TOKEN` with the token generated by `kubeadm init`. Replace `SHA256_HASH` with the certificate hash generated by `kubeadm init`. Replace `MASTER_NODE_1_IP`, `MASTER_NODE_2_IP`, and `MASTER_NODE_3_IP` with the IP addresses of the three master nodes. Replace `CERTIFICATE_KEY` with the certificate key generated by `kubeadm init`. 
12. Join the worker nodes to the cluster by running the command generated by `kubeadm

Person: 
- how to join worker nodes to above cluster

ChatGPT: 
- To join worker nodes to the Kubeadm cluster with 3 master nodes that we created earlier, you can follow the steps below: 
1. SSH into the worker nodes using the command `ssh <worker-node-IP>`. 
2. Install the necessary packages on the worker nodes by running the following command:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common` 
3. Add the Kubernetes signing key on the worker nodes using the command:

`curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -` 
4. Add the Kubernetes repository on the worker nodes using the command:

`sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main"` 
5. Install Kubernetes on the worker nodes using the command:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl` 
6. On any of the master nodes, generate the join command for the worker nodes by running the command:

`sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command`

This command will generate a token and the join command that you can use to join worker nodes to the cluster. 
7. Copy the join command generated in step 6 and paste it in the worker nodes terminal.

The command should look something like this:

`sudo kubeadm join LOAD_BALANCER_DNS:LOAD_BALANCER_PORT --token TOKEN --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash SHA256_HASH`

Replace `LOAD_BALANCER_DNS` with the DNS name or IP address of the load balancer and `LOAD_BALANCER_PORT` with the port number used for the load balancer. Replace `TOKEN` with the token generated by the `kubeadm token create` command. Replace `SHA256_HASH` with the certificate hash generated by the `kubeadm token create` command. 
8. Verify that the worker nodes have successfully joined the cluster by running the command `kubectl get nodes` on any of the master nodes. The output should show all the nodes in the cluster, including the worker nodes.

Person: 
- Can you convert the above results into a lab format

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, here is a step-by-step lab format for joining worker nodes to a Kubeadm cluster with 3 master nodes:

**Objective:**  Join 2 worker nodes to a Kubeadm cluster with 3 master nodes.

**Prerequisites:** 
- 3 Ubuntu 20.04 servers with at least 2 CPU and 4 GB RAM each.
- The 3 servers must have unique hostname, IP address, and SSH access enabled.
- A load balancer must be set up to distribute traffic among the 3 master nodes.
- You must have root or sudo privileges on all servers.

**Steps:** 

**On all 5 nodes:**

To create a Kubeadm cluster with 3 master nodes and 2 worker nodes, you can follow the steps below:

Set up the Virtual Machines (VMs) for the cluster. You can use any virtualization technology like VirtualBox or VMWare. Ensure that the VMs have a minimum of 2GB RAM and 2 CPUs.

Install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on all the VMs.

Disable swap on all the VMs using the command ```sudo swapoff -a```.

Install the necessary packages on all the VMs by running the following command:

```sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common```

Add the Kubernetes signing key on all the VMs using the command:

```curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -```

Add the Kubernetes repository on all the VMs using the command:

```sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main"```

Install Kubernetes on all the VMs using the command:

```sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl```

On the first master node, initialize the cluster by running the command:

```sudo kubeadm init --control-plane-endpoint "LOAD_BALANCER_DNS:LOAD_BALANCER_PORT" --upload-certs --apiserver-cert-extra-sans="MASTER_NODE_1_IP,MASTER_NODE_2_IP,MASTER_NODE_3_IP"```

Replace ```LOAD_BALANCER_DNS``` with the DNS name or IP address of the load balancer and ```LOAD_BALANCER_PORT``` with the port number used for the load balancer. Replace ```MASTER_NODE_1_IP```, ```MASTER_NODE_2_IP```, and ```MASTER_NODE_3_IP``` with the IP addresses of the three master nodes.

After the initialization is complete, copy the kubeconfig file to your home directory using the command:

```mkdir -p $HOME/.kube &amp;&amp; sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config &amp;&amp; sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config```

Install the pod network add-on by running the command:

```kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml```

Join the other two master nodes to the cluster by running the command generated by ```kubeadm init``` on the first master node. The command will look something like this:

```sudo kubeadm join LOAD_BALANCER_DNS:LOAD_BALANCER_PORT --token TOKEN --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash SHA256_HASH --control-plane --certificate-key CERTIFICATE_KEY --apiserver-cert-extra-sans="MASTER_NODE_1_IP,MASTER_NODE_2_IP,MASTER_NODE_3_IP"```

Replace ```LOAD_BALANCER_DNS``` with the DNS name or IP address of the load balancer and ```LOAD_BALANCER_PORT``` with the port number used for the load balancer. Replace ```TOKEN``` with the token generated by ```kubeadm init```. Replace ```SHA256_HASH``` with the certificate hash generated by ```kubeadm init```. Replace ```MASTER_NODE_1_IP```, ```MASTER_NODE_2_IP```, and ```MASTER_NODE_3_IP``` with the IP addresses of the three master nodes. Replace ```CERTIFICATE_KEY``` with the certificate key generated by ```kubeadm init```.
